# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}



```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

```


# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 


Loading the data:

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

```{r confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
kable(favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega))

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

ci_omega <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd = sd(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_diff = sd/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_diff,
            salary_low = mean - margin_of_error,
            salary_high = mean + margin_of_error)

# print the table with confidence interval

kable(ci_omega,
      caption="Salary CI by Gender")

```

What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

**Answer:**\
The two confidence interval for women and men salary of a 95% do not overlap. The difference in salary between the two groups is thus significantly different. The t-test would thus not be needed in this case. 


## Relationship Salary - Gender Hypothesis Test (t.test + infer)

```{r hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)


# hypothesis testing using infer package

#Calculating observed statistic
obs_stat <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("female", "male"))

set.seed(1234)
salaries_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  
  #Which variable we are interested in
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  
  #Hypothesis with no (null) difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  
  #Create simulated samples
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "permute") %>% 
  
  #Mean difference in each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("female", "male")) # give the order for subtraction first, second

#Visualize distribution  
salaries_in_null_world %>% visualize()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, direction = "both") 

salaries_in_null_world %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_stat, direction = "both")


```

What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

**Answer**:\

The R t-test clearly showed that the null hypothesis (no difference) can be rejected. This can be seen by three indicators: first the |t-stat| is approximately > 2, second the CI for delta does not contain zero, third the p-value is < 5%.\
With 1000 reps the bootstrap simulation gave a p-value of zero, this can be the case when the observed statistic is very unlikely. We thus had to increase the reps to 10000 to replicate the results from the formula. 


## Relationship Experience - Gender?


```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

```{r ci_experience}

#Using formula to create confidence interval

ci_omega_experience <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd = sd(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_diff = sd/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_diff,
            experience_low = mean - margin_of_error,
            experience_high = mean + margin_of_error)

# print the table with confidence interval

kable(ci_omega_experience,
      caption="Experience CI by Gender")

```

**Answer:**\

The two experience confidence intervals for women and men at 95% do not overlap. The difference between the two groups is thus significantly different and there is no need to run a t-test. These findings would endager the conclusion drawn above (gender-based salary discrimination) as it seems that not only gender, but an additional previously not considered factor, experience, could influence the pay-gap. Further anaylsis is suggested.


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter, fig.height=4}

ggplot(omega, aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)+
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between salary and experience"
  )+
  theme_bw()

```


## Check correlations between Gender, Experience and Salary


```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

**Answer:**\

The correlation matrix reweals many interesting things in just one visualization. Looking at the scatterplot we can see a clear correlation between years of experience and salary, this is true for both genders. The correlation can also be confirmed mathematically with a total cor of 0.8. In other words, the higher the experience the higher the salary. We have used two colors in the plot above to demonstrate that women salary increase more significantly with growing experience (stepper slope). With women having a median experience of 3 and men of 19.5 it is thus not surprising that there is a significant pay-gap. Omega should rather investigate the underlying reason why women have so little work experience. Are senior positions which require more experience mainly filled by man while graduate positions mainly by women? Anyhow, further investigation is needed!


# Challenge 1: Brexit plot

## Reproduce the Graph using the same colors

The final graph should look like this:

```{r brexit_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "brexit.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r}
brexit_results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.height=4.5}

# Concatenated colors in new variable

parties_brexit_names <- c("Conservative", "Labour", "Lib Dems", "UKIP")
colors_brexit <- c("#0087dc", "#d50000","#FDBB30","#EFE600")

# Tidy long format

tidyresults <- brexit_results %>% 
  select(1:6) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:5,
               names_to = "party",
               values_to = "percentage") 

# Create scatterplot with regression lines

ggplot(tidyresults, aes(x= percentage, y = leave_share, colour = party)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  labs(
    title = "How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting",
    y = "Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referendum",
    x = "Party % in the UK 2015 general election"

        legend.title = element_blank())+

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
                      pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = "Year") %>% 
                      mutate(value=value/(1e9))

# Renaming indicators

tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName=="Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName=="Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName=="General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName=="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"




glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
indicator_list <- c("Exports","Imports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Gross capital formation","Net Exports")

```

## Can you produce this plots?

The first should look like this:
```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r gdp1_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=3.5}

#Creating line chart and setting colors due to different order

tidy_GDP_data %>% 
    mutate(Year=as.integer(Year)) %>% 
    filter(Country %in% country_list, IndicatorName %in% indicator_list) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(Year,value,color=IndicatorName))+
    geom_line(size=0.8)+
    xlim(1970,2017)+
    facet_wrap(~Country)+
    labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In Constant 2010 USD",
       x=NULL,
       y="Billion US$",
       color= "Components of GDP")+
    #scale_color_discrete(name = "Components of GDP")+
   # theme(legend.title = "Components of GDP")+
    scale_color_manual(values = c("#A3A500",
                                  "#00BF7D",
                                  "#F8766D",
                                  "#2FBEF7",
                                  "#EA7DF4"))+
  theme_bw()

```

The second should look like this:
```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r gdp2_self, out.width="100%", fig.height=3.5}

# Going back to wider to easily calculate columns

     scale_color_discrete(name = NULL)+
    theme_bw() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)


```
## What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 





Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

## What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
